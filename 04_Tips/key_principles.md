# Key Principles

1. Every skill should serve two purposes:
   - Make you more employable in IT now
   - Build credibility for cybersecurity later

2. Document everything:
   - Scripts, labs, notes → upload to GitHub
   - Share progress on LinkedIn

3. Focus on free tools until financially stable:
   - Free labs, free tiers, free courses
   - Certifications later (Security+, SC-900)

4. Target IT roles with security overlap:
   - Infrastructure, cloud, networking, endpoint management
